## Phase 2 Tasks: Architecture Design

### Phase 2 Overview
Phase 2 designs the system architecture based on SRS, producing SAD and ADR.
**Exit gate = Agent B peer review of deliverables** (not `harness run-gate --gate 1`).

> **Crash Recovery**: after each push, `HANDOVER.md` is written to project root.
> If context is lost, read `HANDOVER.md` first — it contains phase, status, and next steps.

> **Checkpoint Index** (push to GitHub = checkpoint + HANDOVER.md saved):
> - CHECKPOINT-PEER-REVIEW: Agent B Peer Review (Phase 2 Exit) → `push-checkpoint --phase 2`

### Entry Gate Verification

- **[ENTRY-CHECK]** P1 review-complete:
  Proof: git log contains commit 'phase1(review-complete): Phase 1 deliverables APPROVED'.
  If NOT confirmed: return to Phase 1 and complete exit gate first.

- **[P1-ARTIFACTS]** Verify all 4 Phase 1 deliverables exist (CONSTITUTION.md §2.3 P2 entry requirement):
  ```bash
  ls 01-requirements/SRS.md \
     01-requirements/SPEC_TRACKING.md \
     01-requirements/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md \
     TEST_INVENTORY.yaml
  ```
  All 4 files must exist. If any is missing → return to Phase 1 to complete them before entering Phase 2.

### Pre-Phase Preflight

- **[PREFLIGHT]** Run phase hooks (FSM, Constitution, Kill-Switch, Drift, CI Readiness):
  ```bash
  python3 harness_cli.py run-phase --phase 2 --project .
  ```
  If FAILED: fix FSM/Constitution/Drift issues. There is no gate bypass flag.
  Re-run `run-phase` after each fix. Max 3 attempts.
  After 3 FAIL: escalate to human — provide last `run-phase --phase 2` full output.
  Human fix → re-run `run-phase --phase 2 --project .` → PASS required before continuing.

- **[PREFLIGHT-CI]** Confirm CI wiring unchanged (should be set since P1):
  1. `.github/workflows/harness_quality_gate.yml` exists
  2. Git hooks installed (`ls .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg`)
  3. harness importable (submodule, PYTHONPATH, or vendored `quality_gate/`)
  4. Phase 2 confirmed in `.methodology/state.json` (`advance-phase` already run)
  > If stale: run `python3 harness_cli.py init-project --phase 2 --project . --overwrite`

### 🔄 [PHASE-CONTEXT] — Load Before Starting

```bash
python3 harness_cli.py load-context --phase 2 --project . --json \
  > .sessi-work/phase2_ctx.json
```
> Outputs `fr_ids`, `fr_details`, `modules` from current project state.

### Task Decomposition (Dependency Analysis)

**Phase 2 has 3 deliverables with sequential dependencies:**

| Order | Deliverable | Depends On | Agent A | Agent B |
|-------|------------|------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `SAD.md` | (none — starting point) | ARCHITECT | TECH_LEAD |
| 2 | `ADR.md` | SAD.md | ARCHITECT | TECH_LEAD |
| 3 | `TEST_SPEC.md` | ADR.md | ARCHITECT | TECH_LEAD |

**Execution rule**: Each deliverable must pass Agent B review BEFORE starting the next.
If a deliverable is REJECTED, fix only that deliverable — earlier APPROVED deliverables
are not re-opened. This bounds backtracking to a single step.

### Architecture Design (Serial A/B per Deliverable)

### Sub-Task 1/3: SAD.md — Software Architecture Document — components, interfaces, FR→module mapping, data flows

**Depends on**: none — starting point
**Agent A**: ARCHITECT
**Agent B**: TECH_LEAD

**A/B Work** (HR-04: HybridWorkflow ON — Agent A authors, a separate Agent B sub-agent reviews):
- **[A-1]** Agent A (ARCHITECT): Design system architecture → write SAD.md → validate every FR has a module mapping
  - FORBIDDEN: vague/non-testable acceptance criteria
- **[A-2]** Agent A returns `{status, files, confidence, citations, summary}`
- **[B-1]** Agent B (TECH_LEAD) — dispatch as **STATELESS** subagent:
  > ⚠️  **STATELESS SANDBOX**: Agent B has ZERO access to local files or /tmp.
  > NEVER write 'read 01-requirements/SRS.md' in the prompt — it will fail silently.
  > ALL context must be pasted verbatim into the prompt text. This is mandatory.
  >
  > **Lesson (stateless agent)**: Rounds 2-3 failed because prompts used file paths.
  > Round 4 succeeded only after embedding full document content directly.

  **Embed these documents in full** (copy content, not paths):
  - `01-requirements/SRS.md (full)`
  - `draft 02-architecture/SAD.md (full)`
  - `templates/SAD.md §2.1 (Directory Structure Design Principles)`

  **Agent B prompt structure** (use this template verbatim):
  ```
  You are TECH_LEAD. Your task: review the following deliverable (SAD.md).
  You have NO access to any files — all context is provided below.

  === [DOC 1: 01-requirements/SRS.md (full)] ===
  <<paste full content here>>

  === [DOC 2: draft 02-architecture/SAD.md (full)] ===
  <<paste full content here>>

  === [DOC 3: templates/SAD.md §2.1 (Directory Structure Design Principles)] ===
  <<paste full content here>>

  Review checklist:
  - Every FR maps to ≥1 module?
  - NFRs addressed (latency/security/cost)?
  - No circular dependencies?
  - Data flow diagrams consistent?
  - SAB block present in §5 (<!-- SAB:START --> marker exists)?
  - `phase` is a bare int (not quoted string)? e.g. `phase: 2` not `phase: "2"`
  - All NFR `type` values from legal values (performance/security/maintainability/reliability/testability/deployability/scalability/usability)?
  - Directory structure follows CRG cohesion principles (SAD.md §2.1)?  Hub coverage per dir, per-function-body calls, entry point placement.  See embedded DOC 3 for the full 6 universal principles.
  - No flat dumps or god-modules? (≤15 files per dir, no single dir with all source)

  Return JSON only:
  {"review_status":"APPROVE"|"REJECT",
   "reason":"<concise summary>",
   "citations":["file:line"],
   "docs_embedded":["SRS.md", "SAD.md"],
   "gaps":[{"severity":"low|medium|high","message":"<issue>","fr_id":"<FR-XX or null>"}]}
  ```

- **[B-2]** Agent B returns JSON — parse `review_status` **AND** `gaps` severity:
  > gaps schema: `[{"severity": "low|medium|high", "message": "...", "fr_id": "FR-XX or null"}]`
  - `APPROVE` + all gaps are `low` → continue to Sub-Task 2/3
  - `APPROVE` + any gap is `medium` or `high` → fix gaps → **re-dispatch B as round 2**
    (embed same docs as B-1 above, replacing `SAD.md` with its updated content)
    → continue to Sub-Task 2/3 only after round-2 APPROVE
  - `REJECT` → Agent A fixes gaps → re-dispatch B. Max 5 rounds (HR-12).
    > If round 5 REJECT: escalate to human — orchestrator cannot self-resolve.
    > Human fix → re-dispatch Agent B (same prompt + updated content) → `APPROVE` required before continuing.

  > ⚠️ **BLOCKING**: Do NOT start the next Sub-Task until this sub-task's current
  > round is fully APPROVED (including any required round 2).
  > AgentSpawner records dispatches to `.methodology/sessions_spawn.log` (non-blocking debug trail).

  > fr_id uses P2 as phase-level placeholder; replace with FR-XX for FR-specific plans.

### Sub-Task 2/3: ADR.md — Architecture Decision Records — document key design decisions (tech stack, patterns, interfaces, trade-offs) with context and consequences

**Depends on**: SAD.md (+ Sub-Task 1/3 review: previous review gaps carry forward)
**Agent A**: ARCHITECT
**Agent B**: TECH_LEAD

**A/B Work** (HR-04: HybridWorkflow ON — Agent A authors, a separate Agent B sub-agent reviews):
- **[A-1]** Agent A (ARCHITECT): Extract key architecture decisions from SAD.md → write individual ADR entries → validate rationale and consequences are recorded
  - FORBIDDEN: vague/non-testable acceptance criteria
- **[A-2]** Agent A returns `{status, files, confidence, citations, summary}`
- **[B-1]** Agent B (TECH_LEAD) — dispatch as **STATELESS** subagent:
  > ⚠️  **STATELESS SANDBOX**: Agent B has ZERO access to local files or /tmp.
  > NEVER write 'read 01-requirements/SRS.md' in the prompt — it will fail silently.
  > ALL context must be pasted verbatim into the prompt text. This is mandatory.
  >
  > **Lesson (stateless agent)**: Rounds 2-3 failed because prompts used file paths.
  > Round 4 succeeded only after embedding full document content directly.

  **Embed these documents in full** (copy content, not paths):
  - `Previous Sub-Task B-2 review JSON — SAD.md (Sub-Task 1/3, gaps field may contain non-blocking caveats)`
  - `02-architecture/SAD.md (APPROVED — full content)`
  - `draft 02-architecture/adr/ADR.md (full content)`
  - `templates/ADR.md (template format)`

  **Agent B prompt structure** (use this template verbatim):
  ```
  You are TECH_LEAD. Your task: review the following deliverable (ADR.md).
  You have NO access to any files — all context is provided below.

  Review checklist:
  - Upstream deliverable review caveats addressed? (check previous B-2 gaps field)
  - All major decisions documented (tech stack, patterns, interfaces)?
  - Each ADR has clear context, decision, and consequences?
  - Alternatives considered documented?
  - Decision aligns with SAD.md architecture?

  Return JSON only:
  {"review_status":"APPROVE"|"REJECT",
   "reason":"<concise summary>",
   "citations":["file:line"],
   "docs_embedded":["SRS.md", "SAD.md"],
   "gaps":[{"severity":"low|medium|high","message":"<issue>","fr_id":"<FR-XX or null>"}]}

  > fr_id uses P2 as phase-level placeholder; replace with FR-XX for FR-specific plans.

### 📋 Constitution Quality Self-Check — ADR.md

> **Scoped to the ADR file you just wrote.**
> Catches stub-style or low-density ADRs *before* TEST_SPEC.md depends on them.

- **[CONSTITUTION-CHECK-ADR]** Run single-file constitution check:
  ```bash
  python3 harness_cli.py check-constitution \
      --phase 2 \
      --project . \
      --file 02-architecture/adr/ADR.md
  ```
  - PASS → continue to Sub-Task 3/3 (TEST_SPEC.md)
  - FAIL → fix ADR.md (remove `<!-- harness:template-stub -->` if still present; expand decision/rationale/consequences) and re-run until PASS
  - File missing → `[SKIP]` (exit 0) is reported when ADR.md has not been written yet; in that case **escalate** — Sub-Task 2/3 should have produced this file

### Sub-Task 3/3: TEST_SPEC.md — Test Specification Catalog — named test cases from SRS (single source of truth, D4 unified check)

**Depends on**: ADR.md (+ Sub-Task 2/3 review: previous review gaps carry forward)
**Agent A**: ARCHITECT
**Agent B**: TECH_LEAD

**A/B Work** (HR-04: HybridWorkflow ON — Agent A authors, a separate Agent B sub-agent reviews):
- **[A-1]** Agent A (ARCHITECT): Generate TEST_SPEC.md via derive_test_cases.md skill → preserve TEST_INVENTORY.yaml names where specified → apply 7-Question Protocol per FR → fill concrete Inputs + a Sub-assertion predicate table per FR → run check-test-spec-consistency → populate cross-cutting section
  - FORBIDDEN: vague/non-testable acceptance criteria
- **[A-2]** Agent A returns `{status, files, confidence, citations, summary}`
- **[B-1]** Agent B (TECH_LEAD) — dispatch as **STATELESS** subagent:
  > ⚠️  **STATELESS SANDBOX**: Agent B has ZERO access to local files or /tmp.
  > NEVER write 'read 01-requirements/SRS.md' in the prompt — it will fail silently.
  > ALL context must be pasted verbatim into the prompt text. This is mandatory.
  >
  > **Lesson (stateless agent)**: Rounds 2-3 failed because prompts used file paths.
  > Round 4 succeeded only after embedding full document content directly.

  Review checklist:
  - Upstream deliverable review caveats addressed? (check previous B-2 gaps field)
  - Every FR has ≥1 named test case (happy_path + validation mandatory)?
  - 7-Question Protocol applied per FR (Q1-Q7 as applicable by classification)?
  - Classification assigned per FR (API_ENDPOINT|DATA_ENTITY|ALGORITHM|STATE_MACHINE|INTEGRATION|SECURITY_CONTROL|INFRASTRUCTURE)?
  - NFR Pattern Activation table filled (Step 1 of derive_test_cases.md)?
  - Every case has concrete Inputs in TRUE form (key="value"), NOT pytest-id form (underscore-replaced)?
  - Sub-assertions table populated per FR (rule_id + predicate + applies_to referencing real case #s)?

  > fr_id uses P2 as phase-level placeholder; replace with FR-XX for FR-specific plans.

### SAB Generation (Machine-Readable Architecture Baseline)

> **CONTRACT**: The SAB block in SAD.md §5 is parsed by
> `core/quality_gate/sab_parser.py:extract_sab_from_sad()`.
> Field names, `sab:` root key, `phase` as **int** (not string), and
> NFR `type` values must match `render_canonical_sab_template()` exactly.
> Do NOT hand-write the YAML — paste from the template below.

- **[SAB-WRITE]** Write the SAB block into `02-architecture/SAD.md` §5
  using the canonical template (replace EXAMPLE values with real project values):
  ```yaml
  sab:
    version: "1.0"
    created_at: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
    phase: 2  # MUST be int, NOT a string — parser raises on 'phase: "2"'
    project: "{project_name}"
  
    layers:  # EXAMPLE — replace with your project's layers
      - name: api
        modules: ["app.api.webhooks"]
        allowed_dependencies: ["service"]
  
    allowed_dependencies:
      - from: api
        to: service
  
    quality_targets:
      max_complexity: 15
      min_coverage: 80
      max_coupling: 0.3
  
    nfr_dimension_mapping: {}  # OPTIONAL — auto-derived from nfr_traceability.type
  
    nfr_traceability:
      NFR-01:
        # type MUST be one of 8 legal values listed below:
        # Enforceable (mapped to gate dim):
        #   performance, security, maintainability, reliability, testability
        # Advisory (no scoring tool, auto-added to advisory_only):
        #   deployability, scalability, usability
        type: performance
        target: "p95 < 200ms"  # use ">=N" or "≥N" to raise the gate floor
        module: app.processing.pipeline
  
    advisory_only: []  # AUTO-FILLED by parser — omit or leave []
  
    gate_score_overrides: {}  # AUTO-DERIVED by parser — omit or leave {}
  
    fr_module_traceability:  # EXAMPLE — one entry per FR
      FR-01: "app.api.webhooks"
  
    architecture_constraints:
      - "no_circular_dependencies"
  
    high_risk_modules:
      - "app.api.webhooks"
  ```

- **[SAB-VALIDATE]** Validate the SAB block before committing:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/generate_sab.py --validate --project .
  ```
  - MUST exit 0. On failure the message lists the exact problem
    (e.g. unknown NFR type, `phase` as string).
  - Fix and re-run until PASS.

- **[SAB-GENERATE]** Generate `.methodology/SAB.json` from the validated SAB block:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/generate_sab.py --project .
  ```
  - SAB.json contains all 14 fields from `SABSpec`:
    version, created_at, phase, project, layers, allowed_dependencies,
    quality_targets, nfr_dimension_mapping, nfr_traceability, advisory_only,
    gate_score_overrides, fr_module_traceability, architecture_constraints,
    high_risk_modules.
  - Used by: drift detector (M2), gate architecture dimension, constitution check
  - Also embedded inline in `quality_manifest.json` via `harness_bridge`

### Phase 2 Deliverables
- `SAD.md` — Software Architecture Document (every FR has module mapping)
- `ADR.md` — Architecture Decision Records (tech stack, patterns, interfaces)
- `TEST_SPEC.md` — Test specification catalog (named test cases from SRS, single source of truth — D4 unified check)
- `.methodology/quality_manifest.json` — Quality manifest (FR list + SAB data)
- `.methodology/SAB.json` — Machine-readable architecture baseline
- [x] `.methodology/sessions_spawn.log` — auto-populated by AgentSpawner (non-blocking debug trail)

### 📋 Constitution Quality Self-Check

> **Verify document quality meets constitution standards BEFORE peer review.**
> Run this check, fix gaps, and re-run until PASS. This avoids cascading rewrites after Agent B review.

- **[CONSTITUTION-CHECK]** Run constitution self-check:
  ```bash
  python3 harness_cli.py check-constitution --phase 2 --project .
  ```
  - Score must be ≥ constitution composite threshold
  - If **FAIL**: fix documents (add missing keywords), then **re-run until PASS**
  - If **PASS**: proceed to CHECKPOINT-PEER-REVIEW


### 🔒 CHECKPOINT-PEER-REVIEW: Agent B Peer Review — Phase 2 Exit
> Phase 1/2 exit gate = Agent B document review (NOT `harness run-gate --gate 1`).
> APPROVE criteria: all FRs addressed, no critical gaps, terminology consistent.

- **[B-1]** Agent B (TECH_LEAD) — dispatch as **STATELESS** subagent (holistic review of all deliverables):
  > ⚠️  **STATELESS SANDBOX**: Agent B has ZERO access to local files or /tmp.
  > NEVER pass file paths in the prompt — ALL document content must be pasted verbatim.
  >
  > **Lesson (stateless agent)**: Rounds 2-3 failed because prompts used file paths.
  > Round 4 succeeded only after embedding full document content directly.

  **Embed ALL deliverables in full** (copy content, not paths):
  > Note: `quality_manifest.json` and `SAB.json` are machine-generated by `generate_sab.py`
  > and are NOT embedded for manual review. Agent B reviews the human-authored documents only.
  - `02-architecture/SAD.md (full content)`
  - `02-architecture/adr/ADR.md (full content)`
  - `02-architecture/TEST_SPEC.md (full content)`

  **Agent B prompt structure** (use this template verbatim):
  ```
  You are TECH_LEAD. Your task: holistic review of ALL Phase 2 deliverables.
  You have NO access to any files — all context is provided below.

  === [DOC 1: 02-architecture/SAD.md] ===
  <<paste full content here>>

  === [DOC 2: 02-architecture/adr/ADR.md] ===
  <<paste full content here>>

  === [DOC 3: 02-architecture/TEST_SPEC.md] ===
  <<paste full content here>>

  Review checklist:
  - All FRs covered across all deliverables?
  - No contradictions between deliverables?
  - Each item testable/traceable?
  - All gaps from sub-task reviews addressed?
  - Terminology consistent across all documents?
  - SAB block layers / NFR targets semantically match the module design in SAD §2?
  - Every `fr_module_traceability` entry points to a real module defined in SAD §2?
  - NFR `target` fields contain measurable values (not 'N/A' or empty placeholders)?

  Return JSON only:
  {"review_status":"APPROVE"|"REJECT",
   "reason":"<concise summary>",
   "citations":["file:line"],
   "docs_embedded":["SRS.md", "SAD.md"],
   "gaps":[{"severity":"low|medium|high","message":"<issue>","fr_id":"<FR-XX or null>"}]}
  ```

- **[B-2]** Agent B returns JSON — parse `review_status` **AND** `gaps` severity:
  - `APPROVE` + all gaps are `low` → proceed to push (CHECKPOINT saved)
  - `APPROVE` + any gap is `medium` or `high` → fix gaps → **re-dispatch B as round 2**
    (embed same docs as B-1 above with updated content) → push only after round-2 APPROVE
  - `REJECT` → fix all gaps → re-dispatch B. Max 5 rounds (HR-12).
    > If round 5 REJECT: escalate to human — orchestrator cannot self-resolve.
    > Human fix → re-dispatch Agent B (same prompt + updated content) → `APPROVE` required before continuing.

- **[B-PUSH]** ✅ PUSH ② — Push to GitHub + HANDOVER.md — retry until success (CHECKPOINT-PEER-REVIEW saved):
  > Run `push-checkpoint` → if blocked, read the error → fix → re-run until green.
  > Do NOT use `--no-verify` to bypass.
  ```bash
  python3 harness_cli.py push-checkpoint --phase 2 --project .
  ```
  > This writes `HANDOVER.md` (crash-recovery checkpoint) to project root,
  > then commits + pushes all changes to origin.
  > After a crash, read HANDOVER.md first — it tells you where you were.

### Phase 2 → Phase 3: Implementation

- Advance FSM to Phase 3 (writes new HANDOVER.md + local commit):
  ```bash
  python3 harness_cli.py advance-phase --completed 2 --project .
  ```
- Confirm `HANDOVER.md` reflects Phase 3 entry (`P3-entry` checkpoint, correct plan path)
- Open `phase3_plan.md` and follow from the top.
- If session crashes during Phase 3: read `HANDOVER.md` or run `generate-next-plan`
